                <p>Dolores Abernathy was the first host created in the Argos Initiative and therefore is the oldest host in service in Westworld and was built by Arnold Weber. She outdates all other first-generation hosts such as Clementine, Angela and Craddock. She has been updated numerous times over the years. She has a special connection with her creator, and with one of the guests, the Man in Black.
When the Man in Black visits Dolores' ranch in the episode "The Original", he remarks that she has "a little more pluck" than the last time he saw her. He calls her his "very old friend," and refers to "all that they've been through."</p>
